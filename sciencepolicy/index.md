From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a Science Policy Fellow at the **[Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute)** (STPI), a federally-funded research and development center in Washington, DC. STPI receives funding from the NSF to conduct research and projects for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). STPI also contracts with government agencies across the Executive Branch to offer S&T analysis. 

<br />

These projects generally included research and literature review, interviews, and some project-specific analyses, followed by briefings and formal publications. A run-through of some of my work: 
- A **[study](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/c/co/commercial-development-of-civilian-supersonic-aircraft/d-10845.ashx)** of the technical challenges, existing policies and regulations, and industry efforts for developing supersonic aircraft for commercial use
- Work supporting the White House Initiative on the "Bioeconomy", including a case study of ownership, data sharing, and privacy issues regarding personal genomic data
- Reviews of U.S. Government policy on life sciences dual use research of concern (DURC) and of Federally-funded infectious disease '-omics' databases
- A congressionally mandated **[evaluation](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/e/ev/evaluation-of-a-human-mission-to-mars-by-2033/d-10510.ashx)** of NASA's roadmap for a human mission to Mars by 2033 
- An examination of assessment capabilities across the Federal government, including case studies of evaluation in offices within the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and USAID
- Early research on trends in the on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing of space technologies, including a White House-convened **[summit](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/r/ro/roundtable-proceedings-ways-forward-for-on-orbit-servicing/d-10445.ashx)** 
- A review of laws and regulations governing exports of space technologies and how they are implemented (e.g., International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR))
