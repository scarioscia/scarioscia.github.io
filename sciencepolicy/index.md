From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a Science Policy Fellow at the **[Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute)** (STPI), a federally-funded research and development center in Washington, DC. STPI receives funding from the NSF to conduct research and projects for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). STPI also contracts with government agencies across the Executive Branch to offer S&T analysis. 

<br />

These projects generally included research and literature review, interviews, and some project-specific analyses, followed by briefings and formal publications. A run-through of some of my work: 
- A **[study](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/c/co/commercial-development-of-civilian-supersonic-aircraft/d-10845.ashx)** of the technical challenges, existing policies and regulations, and industry efforts for developing supersonic aircraft for commercial use
- Work supporting the White House Initiative on the "Bioeconomy", including a case study of ownership, data sharing, and privacy issues regarding personal genomic data
- Reviews of U.S. Government policy on life sciences dual use research of concern (DURC) and of Federally-funded infectious disease '-omics' databases
- A congressionally mandated **[evaluation](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/e/ev/evaluation-of-a-human-mission-to-mars-by-2033/d-10510.ashx)** of NASA's roadmap for a human mission to Mars by 2033 
- An examination of assessment capabilities across the Federal government, including case studies of evaluation in offices within the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and USAID
- Early research on trends in the on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing of space technologies, including a White House-convened **[summit](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/r/ro/roundtable-proceedings-ways-forward-for-on-orbit-servicing/d-10445.ashx)** 
- A review of laws and regulations governing exports of space technologies and how they are implemented (e.g., International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR))

#While at STPI, I saw how aspects of science and technology inform government policies, and how those policies influence science within and outside of government. At NASA Johnson we got a tour of the Soyuz capsule from an astronaut who had ridden in it, and we watched other astronauts train for a spacewalk in the neutral buoyancy pool. I joined a colleague for her testimony to the National Space Council at Kennedy Space Center and then caught an elevator with Buzz Aldrin.

#We attended space conferences in Colorado Springs (where we took a day trip to visit Boom Supersonic and visited the red rocks on the way back) and in Bremen, Germany. I made it to a couple of Air Force Bases (Wright-Patterson in Dayton - home of the best museum of flight - and Kirtland in New Mexico) as part of the Executive Committee working on the Air Force's strategy for science and technology in 2030. My last big trip was out to LA where I flew (and crashed) the flight simulator for NASA's supersonic aircraft demonstrator. My favorite day was at a postal distribution center out in Virginia. 

#But this is all on top of spending hours with folks (at STPI, and across government and industry) who were dedicated to using science to inform policy, and keeping track of how policies affected science. We watched March Madness on three TVs at once, went to Congressional hearings and happy hours downtown, pilfered a few souvenirs here and there. I'm grateful for all I that learned, and for it leading me to my lab at JHU.
