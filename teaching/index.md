I've enjoyed teaching since I became a Tutor in the Writing Center as an undergraduate at Georgetown University. We explored approaches to pedagogy and assessment, and I was excited by the chance to connect with others through teaching. I have furthered my training at Johns Hopkins through workshops offered by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning [(CIRTL)](https://www.cirtl.net/) and the JHU Center for Educational Resources [(CER)](https://cer.jhu.edu/).

### Teaching Assistant 

In Fall 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Quantitative Biology (`AS.020.617`) course offered to graduate students in my program. Students develop their own implementations of widely-used computational biology tools (primarily using Python and Bash) for essential studies including assembly of genomes, analysis of transcription factor binding and motifs, detecting genome variation, measuring expression of genes, and understanding genome evolution. 

In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`), where I co-taught an asynchronous section of the course. I was awarded the 2020-2021 Victor G. Corces Teaching Award from the Department of Biology, and I was a 2021 Finalist for the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. 


### Technology Fellowship

I was awarded a 2021 **[Technology Fellowship](https://cer.jhu.edu/techfellows)** from the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources along with [Dylan Taylor](https://dtaylo95.github.io/), another grad student in my lab. We used this support to develop a computational approach for designing CRISPR reagents, which was implemented as a four-week module in the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 sections of the Developmental Genetics Lab course for undergraduates.
