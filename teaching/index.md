I was a teaching assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`) in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. 

Earlier this year, I worked with a fellow grad student in my lab, [Dylan Taylor](https://github.com/dtaylo95), to develop a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU students.
