I've enjoyed teaching since working as a tutor in the Writing Center as an undergraduate at Georgetown University. We explored approaches to pedagogy and assessment, and I was excited by the chance to connect with others through teaching. I have furthered my training at Johns Hopkins through workshops offered by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning [(CIRTL)](https://www.cirtl.net/) and the JHU Center for Educational Resources [(CER)](https://cer.jhu.edu/).

### Modeling Biological Populations 
I am designing a new course for the 2023 Intersession at Johns Hopkins, along with a grad student in my lab, [Andrew Bortvin](https://andrew-bortvin.github.io/). Our course will introduce students to coding in Python, develop models for populations (ranging from invasive species to proliferating cancer cells), and compare their models to real-world data. It is intended for students of all levels (including freshmen) and departments; no experience with biology or coding necessary. We will have "advanced" exercises for those students with significant experience in coding or modeling prior to our course. 


### Quantitative Biology 

In Fall 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Quantitative Biology (`AS.020.617`) course offered to first-year graduate students in the Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics PhD program. Students develop their own implementations of widely-used computational biology tools (primarily using Python and Bash) for essential studies including assembly of genomes, analysis of transcription factor binding and motifs, detecting genome variation, measuring expression of genes, and understanding genome evolution. I'm currently (Fall 2022) a tutor for the course. 

### Developmental Genetics

In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`), where I co-taught an asynchronous section of the course. I was awarded the 2020-2021 Victor G. Corces Teaching Award from the Department of Biology, and I was a 2021 Finalist for the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. 

### Communicating Science 

In Spring 2022 I gave a lecture and hosted an activity session regarding peer review for the Biology Department's Communicating Science course (`AS.020.619`). Students spent half the class period reviewing two peers' Specific Aims (following the convention of the NIH's F31 grant application) and then discussing the feedback they received from their peers. We talked about what worked and why, and students reviewed one more set of Aims for homework that week. See the slides and prompts **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVz10cekga2QBHQQ-ArDTAg5UCpUzb5F/view?usp=sharing)**.

### Teaching Assistant Orientation 

I had the opportunity to co-lead an orientation session for new TAs (usually first- or second-year PhD students) at Johns Hopkins alongside [Alex Gittens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgittens/), a Chemistry PhD student in Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. We covered topics including TA-ing as part of your training, managing the relationship with the professor in charge of the course, and grading, among other things.
