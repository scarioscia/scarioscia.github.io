I am pursuing teaching training through workshops offered by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning [(CIRTL)](https://www.cirtl.net/) and the JHU Center for Educational Resources [(CER)](https://cer.jhu.edu/). My favorite sessions have been a three-part course on Ungrading, where we learned and discussed effective means of giving feedback to students, beyond assigning a number. I also enjoyed the three-day [Teaching Institute](https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy/ti), especially the sections on assessment, active learning, and course planning. 


### Modeling Biological Populations 
I designed a new course for the 2023 Intersession at Johns Hopkins (`AS.020.313`), along with a grad student in my lab, [Andrew Bortvin](https://andrew-bortvin.github.io/). Our course introduced students to coding in Python, developing models for populations (ranging from invasive species to proliferating cancer cells), and comparing their models to real-world data. It was designed for students of all levels (including freshmen) and departments; no experience with biology or coding necessary. We offered "advanced" exercises for those students with significant experience in coding or modeling prior to our course. Check out our **[syllabus](https://andrew-bortvin.github.io/mbp23.github.io/syllabus/)** and find our course materials (lecture notes, coding demonstrations, exercise answer keys) on our course **[Github](https://github.com/scarioscia/modeling_biological_populations)**. 


### Quantitative Biology 

In Fall 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Quantitative Biology (`AS.020.617`) course offered to first-year graduate students in the Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics PhD program. Students develop their own implementations of widely-used computational biology tools (primarily using Python and Bash) for essential studies including assembly of genomes, analysis of transcription factor binding and motifs, detecting genome variation, measuring expression of genes, and understanding genome evolution. I was a tutor for the course in Fall 2022 and am currently a tutor for the spring semester, Quantitative Biology and Biophysics (`AS.020.674`). 

### Developmental Genetics

In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`), where I co-taught an asynchronous section of the course. I was awarded the 2020-2021 Victor G. Corces Teaching Award from the Department of Biology, and I was a 2021 Finalist for the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. 

### Communicating Science 

In Spring 2022 I gave a lecture and hosted an activity session regarding peer review for the Biology Department's Communicating Science course (`AS.020.619`). Students spent half the class period reviewing two peers' Specific Aims (following the convention of the NIH's F31 grant application) and then discussing the feedback they received from their peers. We talked about what worked and why, and students reviewed one more set of Aims for homework that week. See the slides and prompts **[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KVz10cekga2QBHQQ-ArDTAg5UCpUzb5F/view?usp=sharing)**.

### Teaching Assistant Orientation 

I had the opportunity to co-lead an orientation session for new TAs (usually first- or second-year PhD students) at Johns Hopkins alongside [Alex Gittens](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexgittens/), a Chemistry PhD student in Fall 2021 and Spring 2022. We covered topics including TA-ing as part of your training, managing the relationship with the professor in charge of the course, and grading, among other things. See highlights **[here](https://twitter.com/saracarioscia/status/1491049080055021569?s=20&t=Rz-R8nov3GIyFGyiJNKP3Q)** and **[here](https://twitter.com/saracarioscia/status/1430986468290220033?s=20&t=Rz-R8nov3GIyFGyiJNKP3Q)**.

### Georgetown University Writing Center

I worked as a tutor for three years as an undergraduate. I offered one-on-one sessions ranging from 30-60 minutes, working with undergraduate and graduate students on all steps of the writing process - from brainstorming, outlining, and drafting to review and editing. I especially focused on scientific writing.
