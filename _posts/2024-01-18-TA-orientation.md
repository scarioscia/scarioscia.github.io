title: Advice for incoming teaching assistants 
---

Being a teaching assistant (TA) is HARD! There are so many demands on your time, along with the conflicting pressure to both follow the instructions and (hopefully) meet your students where they are. This can be made more challenging in a large class with multiple sections and the decrease in flexibility (with lesson plans, pace, grading, feedback, etc.) that accompanies the necessary standardization.

In conversations with experienced and new TAs, some of the major themes I've come across are advocating for yourself in the classroom (making sure you're getting what you need from this training opportunity!) and dealing with grading undergraduates.
