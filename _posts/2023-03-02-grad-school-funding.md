This is an oldie but a goodie... In 2021, Johns Hopkins career services hosted a multi-day event called [Grad Camp](https://imagine.jhu.edu/channels/grad-camp/), a series of workshops and panels designed to guide prospective grad students through the application and decision-making process. I was on a panel titled "How To NOT Pay for Grad School." You can check out the recording of the whole session [here](https://imagine.jhu.edu/videos/103226/). 

Check out the highlights and major takeaways in my thread below, and I'm always happy to chat about this or anything else!
