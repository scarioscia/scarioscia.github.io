title: Growth through peer editing: a hands-on seminar  
---

In research and writing of any kind, the process of peer editing can play a role in refining ideas, strengthening arguments, and enhancing overall quality. Some of the classes I've taken in grad school have included peer editing as part of the assignment structure - offering students training in providing and using constructive feedback. 

For the last few years I've guest lectured in a science writing class on this topic, outlining the benefits and intentions of peer editing. Here is the structure of the 45-minute workshop in case it's useful for you! 


## Setting the Stage

At the onset of our seminar, we provide a brief overview of the intentions behind peer editing. Whether the goal is securing funding, effectively communicating results, or encouraging resource utilization, peer editing aligns with the broader objectives of the writer. We emphasize the importance of actionable and manageable feedback that supports the writer's goals, fostering a collaborative and constructive environment.

It can help to go over the specific goals of the document being reviewed. If it's a grant, the goal is funding; if it's a description of a new laboratory or computational method, it's resource adoption. Peer editing should help the writer better achieve those goals. We also outline the benefits to both participants in peer editing: 


### For writers: 

- Fresh perspecctives 
- Identify blind spots, gaps in reasoning, unstated assumptions 
- Enhance clarity 


### For editors:

- Critical thinking (analyze and evaluate written work) 
- Clear, direct communication 
- Exposure to different writing styles, techniques, subjects
- Empathetic feedback (improve emotional IQ!) 


## Practical Application

To facilitate hands-on learning, participants swap assignments and dedicate 5-7 minutes to reviewing and crafting feedback. Emphasizing the importance of specificity, we encourage participants to pinpoint areas for improvement while offering practical suggestions for enhancement. 

Following this exercise, the instructor can prompt students to share aloud feedback they found particularly helpful, fostering dialogue and mutual learning. These can be listed on the board/added to slides for future reference. 

As a visual aid, we display a single paragraph from a willing student's draft on the board. Through live-editing, we demonstrate the thought process behind each edit, highlighting the rationale behind suggested changes. Integrating insights from previous feedback sharing, we ensure that each edit serves the writer's intended purpose, reinforcing the importance of aligning feedback with overarching goals.


## Iterative Learning

Armed with newfound insights and experiences, participants engage in a second round of peer editing. Partnering with different students and receiving fresh perspectives, they apply lessons learned from the previous session to refine their feedback further. This can help reinforce learning and foster a classroom culture of continuous improvement and collaboration. 

This skillset can be further developed through practice, such as by integrating peer editing regularly throughout the remainder of the course (e.g., as homework assignments or in small gruop activities). 


## Conclusion

By emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between writer and editor, encouraging actionable feedback, and promoting iterative learning, we empower students to navigate writing with confidence and proficiency.
