title: A hands-on seminar for peer editing
---

In research and writing of any kind, the process of peer editing can play a role in refining ideas, strengthening arguments, and enhancing overall quality. Some of the classes I've taken in grad school have included peer editing as part of the assignment structure - offering students training in providing and using constructive feedback. 

For the last few years I've guest lectured in a science writing class on this topic, outlining the benefits and intentions of peer editing. Here is the structure of the 45-minute workshop in case it's useful for you! 


## What is peer editing - and why? 

At the onset of our seminar, we provide a brief overview of the intentions behind peer editing. Whether the goal is securing funding, effectively communicating results, or encouraging resource utilization, peer editing aligns with the broader objectives of the writer. We emphasize the importance of **actionable and manageable feedback** that supports the writer's goals.

It can help to go over the specific goals of the document being reviewed. For example, if it's a grant application, the goal is funding; if it's a description of a new laboratory or computational method, the goal is resource adoption. Peer editing should help the writer better achieve those goals. 

We also outline the benefits to both participants: 


### For writers

- Identify blind spots, gaps in reasoning, unstated assumptions 
- Fresh perspectives on the work
- Enhance clarity 


### For editors

- Critical thinking (analyze and evaluate written work) 
- Clear, direct communication 
- Exposure to different writing styles, techniques, subjects
- Empathetic feedback (improve emotional IQ!) 


## Practical Application

To facilitate hands-on learning, participants swap assignments and spend 5-7 minutes reviewing the work and offering feedback. Emphasizing specificity in their suggestions, we encourage participants to pinpoint areas for improvement while offering practical opportunities for enhancement. 

Following this exercise, the instructor can prompt students to share aloud feedback they found particularly helpful, fostering dialogue and mutual learning. These can be added to the slides for future reference. 

As a visual aid, and if time allows, it can be helpful to display a single paragraph from a similar assignment's draft on the board (e.g., an example written by the instructor ahead of time). The group can live-edit the document together, discussing the thought process behind each edit and highlighting the rationale behind suggested changes. Integrating insights from the previous round of editing, we ensure that each comment serves the writer's intended purpose, reinforcing the importance of aligning feedback with the document's goals.


## Iterative Learning

Building on this (and with the best practices and tips displayed on on the board), participants engage in a second round of peer editing, this time with different partners. This can help reinforce learning and foster a classroom culture of continuous improvement and collaboration. 

This skillset can be further developed through practice, such as by integrating peer editing regularly throughout the remainder of the course (e.g., as homework assignments or in small gruop activities). 


## Conclusion

By emphasizing the benefits to both writer and editor, encouraging actionable feedback, and promoting iterative learning, we empower students to navigate writing with confidence and proficiency.
