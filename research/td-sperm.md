### Testing for transmission distortion in a large sample of human sperm genomes
Mendel’s Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby “selfish” alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such transmission distortion (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part due to statistical and sample size limitations of past studies.

We leveraged [recently published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351608/) single-cell sequencing data from over 40,000 individual sperm across 25 donors. This scan enabled us to look at an earlier developmental time point than had been considered in previous studies, with the possibility of avoiding the effects of downstream selection and other biases. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission, in contrast to tenuous signals of TD that were previously reported in pedigree-based studies.
