### Testing for transmission distortion in a large sample of human sperm genomes
Mendel’s Law of Segregation states that the offspring of a diploid, heterozygous parent will inherit either allele with equal probability. While the vast majority of loci adhere to this rule, research in model and non-model organisms has uncovered numerous exceptions whereby “selfish” alleles are disproportionately transmitted to the next generation. Evidence of such transmission distortion (TD) in humans remains equivocal in part due to statistical and sample size limitations of past studies.

We leveraged [recently published](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351608/) single-cell sequencing data from over 40,000 individual sperm across 25 donors. This scan enabled us to look at an earlier developmental time point than had been considered in previous studies, with the possibility of avoiding the effects of downstream selection and other biases. Our results exhibited close concordance with binomial expectations under balanced transmission, in contrast to tenuous signals of TD that were previously reported in pedigree-based studies. See our paper **[here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76383)** and our code **[here](https://github.com/mccoy-lab/transmission-distortion)**.


### rhapsodi: an R package to impute sparsely sequenced haploid genomes 
The recent development of high-throughput single-cell genome sequencing of human sperm (termed "Sperm-seq") offers an opportunity to study various aspects of meiosis and inheritance with improved statistical power. However, the low sequencing coverage per cell (0.01x) necessitates the development of tailored statistical methods for recovering gamete genotypes.

To this end, we developed a method called rhapsodi (R haploid sperm/oocyte data imputation) that uses low-coverage single-cell DNA sequencing data from large samples of gametes to reconstruct phased donor haplotypes, impute gamete genotypes, and map meiotic recombination events. rhapsodi is introduced in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76383); it is available as a user-friendly and thoroughly benchmarked package **[here](https://github.com/mccoy-lab/rhapsodi)**. 


### Technology Fellowship 
I was awarded a 2021 **[Technology Fellowship](https://cer.jhu.edu/techfellows)** from the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources along with [Dylan Taylor](https://dtaylo95.github.io/), another grad student in my lab. We used this support to develop a computational approach for designing CRISPR reagents, which was implemented as a four-week module in the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 sections of the Developmental Genetics Lab course for undergraduates.


### Science Policy

From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a Science Policy Fellow at the **[Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute)** (STPI), a federally-funded research and development center in Washington, DC. STPI receives funding from the NSF to conduct research and projects for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). STPI also contracts with government agencies across the Executive Branch to offer science and technology analysis. 

These projects generally included research and literature review, interviews, and some project-specific analyses, followed by briefings, conference presentations, and formal publications. Some of my work includes: 
- A **[study](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/c/co/commercial-development-of-civilian-supersonic-aircraft/d-10845.ashx)** of the technical challenges, existing policies and regulations, and industry efforts for developing supersonic aircraft for commercial use
- Work supporting the White House Initiative on the "Bioeconomy", including a case study of ownership, data sharing, and privacy issues regarding personal genomic data
- Reviews of U.S. Government policy on life sciences dual use research of concern (DURC) and of Federally-funded infectious disease '-omics' databases
- A congressionally mandated **[evaluation](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/e/ev/evaluation-of-a-human-mission-to-mars-by-2033/d-10510.ashx)** of NASA's roadmap for a human mission to Mars by 2033 
- An examination of assessment capabilities across the Federal government, including case studies of evaluation in offices within the Department of Defense, Department of Labor, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and USAID
- A **[review](https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/t/to/towards-the-development-of-a-national-planetary-protection-policy)** of planetary protection policies and approaches, as well as a summary of U.S. and international laws, regulations, policies and practices governing planetary protection
- Early research on trends in the on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing of space technologies, including a White House-convened **[summit](https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/r/ro/roundtable-proceedings-ways-forward-for-on-orbit-servicing/d-10445.ashx)** 
- A review of laws and regulations governing exports of space technologies and how they are implemented, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR)
