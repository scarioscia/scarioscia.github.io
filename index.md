I completed my PhD in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University, supported by a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org/) and advised by [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). My work focuses on applying computational and statistical methods to large-scale human genomic data. My dissertation work examined how errors and biases in chromosome segregation arise during human development and how they impact genetic transmission and fertility. This research combined population genetics, statistical modeling, and analysis of IVF embryo sequencing data. Additional details are available on my research page.

I am currently a Data Scientist at [Valo Health](https://valohealth.com/), where I work with complex biomedical datasets to support target discovery and drug development.

I received my undergraduate degree in Biology and Classics from Georgetown University, where I developed evolutionary models and simulations with [Manus Patten](https://www.pattenlab.com/). Prior to graduate school, I spent two years as a Science Policy Fellow at the [Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute) (STPI), contributing to technical and regulatory [projects](https://scarioscia.github.io/2023-01-25/science-policy) for U.S. Executive Branch agencies including the NIH and NASA.

Outside of work, I’m an avid cyclist and compete in gravel and cyclocross races in the Washington, DC area. I serve on the Board of Directors of the [Friends of the Mount Vernon Trail](https://mountvernontrail.org/), supporting program planning and partnerships to maintain and improve the trail.
