# About

Iâ€™m a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://nsfgrfp.org/) and PhD Candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University. I'm advised by [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/) and am broadly interested in human genomics and evolution. My thesis explores bias, dispersion, and error in human development. Currently I'm using data from IVF embryos to investigate genetic influences on human fertility phenotypes.

I majored in Biology and Classics at Georgetown University, where I conducted research with [Manus Patten](https://www.pattenlab.com/). I then spent two years as a Science Policy Fellow at the [Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute) (STPI), working on projects for Executive Branch agencies including the NIH and NASA.

Outside of research, I'm an avid cyclist. I compete with the Hopkins cycling team in the fall cyclocross season, and I mountain bike whenever I can. I'm a member of the Board of Directors of the [Friends of the Mount Vernon Trail](https://mountvernontrail.org/), which works with the National Park Service to maintain and improve the trail. I'm a member of the Board of Directors for the Rosslyn Business Improvement District (BID) in Arlington, VA, where I contribute to projects supporting transportation and outdoor spaces in the region.
