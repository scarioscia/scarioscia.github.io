I completed my PhD in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/) and supported by a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://nsfgrfp.org/). I am interested in answering some of the most fundamental questions in human genetics - especially the genetic and molecular causes of errors and biases in inheritance. To answer these questions, I've developed and applied computational and statistical methods for use with large-scale human genomic data. My dissertation examined how errors and biases in chromosome segregation arise during human development and how they impact genetic transmission and fertility. 

I was especially excited by our most recent work (Carioscia et al. 2026, accepted _Nature_, [_medRxiv_](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.02.25325097v2)), where we uncover the strongest evidence yet for how common genetic variants influence  risk of early pregnancy loss. In prior work, we estimate a realistic range for how often whole-chromosome genetic errors occur in eggs, sperm, and early embryos (Yang, Carioscia et al. 2025, [_Genetics_](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/231/2/iyaf149/8220568)). 

I'm currently a Data Scientist at [Valo Health](https://valohealth.com/). Our mission is to identify new drug targets for some of the most devastating and prevalent diseases. In this role, I apply my computational and statistical methods to support our scientific goals and improve experimental procedures.

I received my undergraduate degree in Biology and Classics from Georgetown University, where I developed evolutionary models and simulations with [Manus Patten](https://www.pattenlab.com/). Prior to graduate school, I spent two years as a Science Policy Fellow at the [Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute) (STPI), contributing to technical and regulatory [projects](https://scarioscia.github.io/2023-01-25/science-policy) for U.S. Executive Branch agencies including the NIH and NASA.

Outside of work, I’m an avid cyclist and compete in gravel and cyclocross races in the Washington, DC area. I serve on the Board of Directors of the [Friends of the Mount Vernon Trail](https://mountvernontrail.org/), supporting program planning and partnerships to maintain and improve the trail.
