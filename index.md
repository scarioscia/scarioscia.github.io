# About

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the **[Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/)** (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University, advised by **[Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/)**. My current research investigates the phenomenon of transmission distortion, whereby inheritance deviates from Mendelian expectations. Here's a [link](https://github.com/scarioscia/scarioscia.github.io/blob/master/CV/Carioscia_CV_052120.pdf) to my CV. 

I majored in Biology and Classics at Georgetown University, where I conducted research in the lab of **[Manus Patten](https://www.pattenlab.com/)**. I then spent two years as a Science Policy Fellow at the **[Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute)** (STPI), a federally-funded research and development center working for Executive Branch agencies.

Outside of research, I am an avid cyclist - I finally got a gravel bike and compete with the Hopkins team in cyclocross races around DC, MD, and VA. I also love to geek out about hiking, rock climbing, and the U.S. Postal Service. This summer, I'm trying to learn Italian; still not sure what to do with myself when I run out of my 5 hearts each day on Duolingo.
