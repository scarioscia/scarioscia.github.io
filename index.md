# About

I'm a PhD candidate in the **[Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/)** (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University, advised by **[Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/)**. I study the impacts of large genetic variants, called *structural variants*, on human evolution.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from Cornell University, where I did research in the lab of **[Scott Emr](https://emr.wicmb.cornell.edu/)**.

Currently, one of my most exciting non-research projects is recreating all [26 varieties](https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/currydex.shtml) of curry from *Pokémon Sword and Shield* in real life. As of September 2020, I have 20 out of 26 curries completed!
