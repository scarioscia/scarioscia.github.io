# About

Iâ€™m a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and PhD Candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) (CMDB) program at Johns Hopkins University. 

I am advised by **[Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/)**, and our lab broadly looks at evolution and genomics in humans. My current research investigates the possibility of transmission distortion in humans, whereby inheritance deviates from Mendelian expectations.

I majored in Biology and Classics at Georgetown University, where I conducted research with Professor [Manus Patten](https://www.pattenlab.com/). I then spent two years as a Science Policy Fellow at the [Science and Technology Policy Institute](https://www.ida.org/en/ida-ffrdcs/science-and-technology-policy-institute) (STPI), working on projects for Executive Branch agencies including the NIH and NASA.

Outside of research, I am an avid cyclist - I am obsessed with my gravel bike, and I compete with the Hopkins team in cyclocross races around the DMV. I also love to geek out about hiking, bikepacking, rock climbing, and the U.S. Postal Service. This summer, I'm trying to learn Italian; open to all advice both for learning the language and for what to do when I run out of my 5 hearts each day on Duolingo. 

Here's a **[link](https://github.com/scarioscia/scarioscia.github.io/blob/master/CV/Carioscia_CV_052120.pdf)** to my CV.
