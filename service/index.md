# Teaching

Teaching has been a priority for me since I became a Tutor in the Writing Center as an undergraduate at Georgetown University. We explored approaches to pedagogy and assessment, and I was excited by the chance to connect with others through teaching. I have furthered my training at Johns Hopkins through workshops offered by the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning [(CIRTL)](https://www.cirtl.net/) and the JHU Center for Educational Resources [(CER)](https://cer.jhu.edu/).

### Teaching Assistant 

In Fall 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Quantitative Biology (`AS.020.617`) course offered to graduate students in my program. Students develop their own implementations of widely-used computational biology tools (primarily using Python and Bash) for essential studies including assembly of genomes, analysis of transcription factor binding and motifs, detecting genome variation, measuring expression of genes, and understanding genome evolution. 

In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`), where I co-taught an asynchronous section of the course. I was awarded the 2020-2021 Victor G. Corces Teaching Award from the Department of Biology, and I was a 2021 Finalist for the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. 


### Technology Fellowship

I was recently awarded a **[Technology Fellowship](https://cer.jhu.edu/techfellows)** from the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources. I'm partnering with Carolyn Norris, the Developmental Genetics Professor, and [Dylan Taylor](https://dtaylo95.github.io/), another grad student in my lab. We are using this support to develop a computational approach for designing CRISPR reagents, which were piloted in the Fall 2021 sections of Developmental Genetics Lab and will be updated for the Spring 2022 course.

# symBIOsis

I'm a member of the organizational board of **[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)**, a graduate student organization in the Department of Biology founded in 2020.

A few things we offer to PhD students in the Biology Department:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

We also run the BioBuddies program, which pairs incoming CMDB first years with upper-year mentors. I had my first BioBuddy last year, and sharing our grad experiences made even a bizarre year really wonderful.

# Agara Bio 
Earlier this year, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates.
