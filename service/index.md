# symBIOsis

From 2020-2022, I was a member of the organizational board of **[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)**, a graduate student group in the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins founded by PhD students in 2020.

A few things we offer to biology grad students:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Mentorship pairing and events to connect first years with upper year students (Biobuddies)
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

# Agara Bio 
In 2020 and 2021, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology **[workshop series](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop)** on hidden markov models for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates. Check out our workbooks and let us know if you have any questions or suggestions! 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So excited to share the materials from our tutorial on hidden Markov models, developed with my fave co-conspirator <a href="https://twitter.com/tlrdln22?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tlrdln22</a> + the support of <a href="https://twitter.com/AgaraBio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AgaraBio</a>.
