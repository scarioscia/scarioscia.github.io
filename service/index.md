# Teaching

I was a teaching assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`) in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. I co-taught an asynchronous section with my friend (who is also a grad student in my lab) [Dylan Taylor](https://github.com/dtaylo95). Dylan and I were awarded the 2020-2021 Victor G. Corces Teaching Award for our work in this course. I was also a 2021 finalist for the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. 

We were recently awarded a **[Technology Fellowship](https://cer.jhu.edu/techfellows)** from the Johns Hopkins Center for Educational Resources. We'll use this support to develop a computational approach for designing CRISPR reagents, which will be implemented in the Fall 2021 sections of Developmental Genetics Lab. 

Earlier this year, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates.

# symBIOsis

**[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)** was founded in 2020 as a graduate student organization in the Department of Biology.

A few things our 5-person board organizes:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

We also run the BioBuddies program, which pairs incoming CMDB first years with upper-year mentors. I had my first BioBuddy this year, and sharing our grad experiences made even a bizarre year really wonderful (I can't believe I met her in-person for the first time in late June!).
