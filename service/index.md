# Teaching

I was a teaching assistant for the Biology Department's undergraduate Developmental Genetics Lab (`AS.020.340`) in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021. 

Earlier this year, I worked with a fellow grad student in my lab, [Dylan Taylor](https://github.com/dtaylo95), to develop a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates.

# symBIOsis

**[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)** was founded in 2020 as a graduate student organization in the Department of Biology.

Among other things, symBIOsis organizes:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

We also run the BioBuddies program, which pairs incoming CMDB first years with upper-year mentors.
