## symBIOsis

From 2020-2022, I was a member of the organizational board of **[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)**, a graduate student group in the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins founded by PhD students in 2020.

A few things we offer to biology grad students:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Mentorship pairing and events to connect first years with upper year students (Biobuddies)
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

Check out our [highlights](https://twitter.com/saracarioscia/status/1567917420232441857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) for applying to the NSF GRFP. And if you'd like to see any of the other resources, send me an email!

## Computationally Designing CRISPR Reagents 

I was awarded a 2021 **[Institutional Enhancement Grant](https://ctei.jhu.edu/programs-and-services/instructional-enhancement-grant-program)** from the Johns Hopkins Center for Teaching Excellence & Innovation along with [Dylan Taylor](https://dtaylo95.github.io/), another grad student in my lab. We used this support to develop a computational approach for designing CRISPR reagents, which was implemented as a five-week module in the Fall 2021 and Spring 2022 sections of the Developmental Genetics Lab course for undergraduates. 

We've updated these resources to offer a standalone module for anyone interested in learning and using Python; check out our **[GitHub](https://github.com/dtaylo95/A-Computational-Approach-to-CRISPR-Reagent-Design)**. Together, the notebooks form the foundation of a program to generate CRISPR reagents for any target sequence and any tag modification.

## Hidden Markov Models in Python

In 2020 and 2021, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology **[workshop series](https://twitter.com/saracarioscia/status/1364238709869207552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)** on hidden markov models for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by Johns Hopkins undergraduates. 

These notebooks offer a module to take users through introductory Python and HMM basics to developing a standalone model to parse any DNA sequence. Check out our **[GitHub](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop)**, and let us know if you have any questions or suggestions!
