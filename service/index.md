# symBIOsis

From 2020-2022, I was a member of the organizational board of **[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)**, a graduate student group in the Department of Biology at Johns Hopkins founded by PhD students in 2020.

A few things we offer to biology grad students:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Mentorship pairing and events to connect first years with upper year students (Biobuddies)
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

Check out our tips for applying to the NSF GRFP [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1M1hr1OdK16kZgldhz6II0WvysWFV9ry6/&export=download). And if you'd like to see any of the other resources, send me an email!

# Agara Bio 
In 2020 and 2021, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates.
