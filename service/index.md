# symBIOsis

From 2020-2022, I was a member of the organizational board of **[symBIOsis](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/)**, a graduate student organization in the Department of Biology founded in 2020.

A few things we offer to PhD students in the Biology Department:

* Practice rotation talks for first years
* Mock qualifying exams for second years
* Advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications
* Mentorship pairing and events to connect first years with upper year students (Biobuddies)
* Resources for grad school (Baltimore housing guide, fellowship examples)
* Social events (trivia nights, movie screenings)

# Agara Bio 
In 2020 and 2021, Dylan and I created and taught a two-part computational biology workshop series on [hidden markov models](https://github.com/scarioscia/hmm_workshop) for [Agara Bio](https://www.agarabio.org/), a community bio lab led by JHU undergraduates.
