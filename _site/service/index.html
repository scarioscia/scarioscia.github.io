<h2 id="symbiosis">symBIOsis</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/symbiosis/">symBIOsis</a></strong> was founded in 2020 by members of of <strong><a href="https://biominds.jhu.edu/">MInDS</a></strong>, a graduate student organization in the Department of Biology.</p>

<p>Among other things, we organize practice rotation talks for first years, mock qualifying exams for second years, advising meetings on topics like choosing thesis labs and writing grant applications, and social events like virtual trivia nights and movie screenings.</p>

<p>We also run (and often serve as mentors for) the BioBuddies program, which pairs incoming CMDB first years with upper-year mentors.</p>

<h2 id="bioreps">BioReps</h2>

<p>The BioReps are liasons between their graduate cohort and the CMDB program directors and administration. They’re also involved in running recruitment for prospective graduate students every year.</p>

<p>Some initiatives I’ve been part of as a BioRep are administering a survey on department climate issues, trying to implement a teaching feedback system for graduate TAs, and organizing department town halls during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>

<p>I’m currently a TA for the CMDB program’s Quantitative Biology Lab course (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AS.020.617</code>), as well as our one-week <strong><a href="http://bxlab.github.io/cmdb-bootcamp/">Quantitative Biology Bootcamp</a></strong> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AS.020.607</code>). These courses introduce new PhD students — many of whom have no coding experience — to computational biology.</p>

<p>In the 2019-2020 academic year, I was a teaching assistant for Developmental Genetics Lab (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AS.020.340</code>), an undergraduate lab course.</p>
