## About me 
Hello all! I'm a 4th year PhD student advised by [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/).

## Three fun facts about me 
1. I love biking and I'm on the cycling team at Hopkins. 
2. I'm a junior ranger at about 10 National Parks (my first was Yellowstone in 2017). 
3. In undergrad I studied Classics - Latin language, Egyptian hieroglyphs, ancient literature... I'm hoping to take a class at JHU next semetser just for fun! 

## Currently reading... 
1. Just finished [American Wolf](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/248840/american-wolf-by-nate-blakeslee/), strongly recommend 
2. Working my way through [The Gene's-Eye View of Evolution](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-genes-eye-view-of-evolution-9780198862260). JHU ordered it for me to their library so it'll be free for you in a few weeks!
